# PrimeNumberPy
Find if a number is prime or not

Command line program where it will find out if the provided number is prime or not.

We try dividing odd numbers by 3, 5, 7, 11, and other odd numbers as long as the divisor is less than or equal to square root of the number, and check for zero remainders.

Simple algo, getting to coding after a long time!
